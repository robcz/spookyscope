# What is this?

A simple application to generate random images and see if a face can be detected in each random frame.

I needed to bridge the gap between [This great OpenCV related demo](https://github.com/xperience-ai/oreilly_opencv_workshop2018.git) and a [more detailed book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076Q9RBF3/) on the subject, and the way I learn best is by doing.
